   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 2,390 out of  15,822   15%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        6,071
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,675 out of   6,071   44%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             140 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
