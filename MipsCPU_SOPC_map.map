WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net MipsCPU0/ctrl0/n0001 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  15,616    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      5
      Number with same-slice register load:      1
      Number with same-slice carry load:         4
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                12,823 out of  15,822   81%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       34,950
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:        25,069 out of  34,950   71%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 603 out of  34,950    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       9,278 out of  34,950   26%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              22 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
