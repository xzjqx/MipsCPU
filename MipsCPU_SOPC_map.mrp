Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 9,971 out of 126,576    7%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               9,837
    Number used as Latches:                    134
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                     34,326 out of  63,288   54%
    Number used as logic:                   34,322 out of  63,288   54%
      Number using O6 output only:          33,572
      Number using O5 output only:             117
      Number using O5 and O6:                  633
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  15,616    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      4
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         4
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       35,696
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:        25,808 out of  35,696   72%
    Number with an unused LUT:               1,370 out of  35,696    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       8,518 out of  35,696   23%
    Number of unique control sets:           1,045
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              21 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        18 out of     480    3%
