<msg type="warning" file="NgdBuild" num="931" delta="old" >The value of SIM_DEVICE on instance &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">cpu0/instance_name/pll_base_inst/PLL_ADV</arg>&apos; of type <arg fmt="%s" index="2">PLL_ADV</arg> has been changed from &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">VIRTEX5</arg>&apos; to &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="4">SPARTAN6</arg>&apos; to correct post-ngdbuild and timing simulation for this primitive.  In order for functional simulation to be correct, the value of SIM_DEVICE should be changed in this same manner in the source netlist or constraint file.
